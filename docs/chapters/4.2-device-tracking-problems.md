# Device Tracking Problems



-----

### The Event Log shows the following message but I can not find the 'platform: icloud3' parameter

```
iCloud3 is an Integration. Delete the 'platform: icloud3'
configuration parameters in the HA 'configuration.yaml' file.
```

### The phone does not go to an Away state when you exit a zone

Not changing to Away when you leave a zone means iCloud3 is not getting the zone exit trigger from the iOS app. Check the following:

1. Verify the iOS App device_tracker entity name has not changed. 

   - Go to *Configuration > iCloud3 Devices > Select device> iOS App device_tracker entity* and verify the tracked device has a valid iOS App device_tracker entity assigned.

2. The HA mobile app integration is not installed. 

   - Go to *Installing and Configuring iCloud3 > Step #2 - Install the iOS App on your iPhone or iPad* for more information.

3. The iOS app device_tracker entity location is not being updated by the iOS app. 

   - The iOS App logs events as they take place, including location changes and zone enter/exit activity. On the device, open the iOS App. Select *HA Settings > Companion App > Debugging*. Then select *Event Log* to see what events the iOS App responded to or *Location History* to display a map showing the devices location at various times.

   - Check the device_tracker state value to see if is being updated. Go to *Developer Tools > States > device_tracker entity* and see if the zone name is displayed. The value is *not_home* when you are not in a zone and the zone's name when you are in a zone.

   - Verify the iOS App is sharing location information. Go to *Installing and Configuring iCloud3 > Step #2 - Install the iOS App on your iPhone or iPad* for screenshots of the correct settings.

   - Tracking Monitors can be displayed in the Event Log that show update activity. Select *Event Log > Actions > Show/Hide Tracking Monitors*. Look at the state change and trigger change values and times they changed. See *Debugging with Tracking Monitors* below.

### Not all of the devices are being tracked

iCloud3 uses the location data from your iCloud account to track and locate your devices. If iCloud3 reports the location of some devices correctly but does not locate others, the devices not tracked are probably not set up correctly.

Check the following on the untracked devices:
- **Settings App > Privacy & Security**:
  - **Locations Services** is On
  - **Share My Location >**
    - *Find My iPhone* is On
    - *Share My Location* is On
    - *Family* > This shows the Family members this device can see in the FindMy app. Make sure all the people you are tracking with iCloud3 are listed. This does not list each device for the Family member, just the person.
    - *Friends* > This shows the Friends you have sent an invitation to and requested that they share their location. They can be tracked using the Find-my-Friends tracking method.

- **FindMy App**:
  - **People** > This should show all the people sharing their location. All the people having devices tracked with iCloud3 should be listed here.
  - **Devices** > This shows every device that is being located and tracked. If the device is not listed here, it can not be tracked by iCloud3. 
    - One device is the owner of the iCloud Account. It must be able see all of the devices you want to track on this parameter and on the map. If a device is not shown, iCloud3 will not be able to track it.
    - Make sure there is not more than one than one device for the same person. For example, when you upgrade your phone, the old one is not removed from the Family Sharing account, the new one will be added with the same name as the old one with a suffix *(2)*. iCloud3 will continue to track the old device (which does not exist), not the new one.

- **Event Log:**

  - **Stage 4 > Setup iCloud & iOSApp Tracking Methods, Family Sharing List devices** - This stage lists all of the devices in the Family Sharing List on your iCloud account. 

    - A *check mark* indicates the device is being tracked by iCloud3. 

    - A *No Location* message indicates iCloud did not return any location information. iCloud3 will do several retries to clear this up before displaying an error message.

    - A *Not Tracked* message indicates this device is not in the iCloud3 configuration.

    - Stages 3 show how the devices are configured in the iCloud3 Configuration. Stage 5 shows the final results.

- **iCloud3 Configuration Wizard:**

  - **Update Device screen** - Check the *Update Device* screen for the device that is not being tracked. Verify the Family Sharing device is set to the correct one. If you upgraded your phone and did not delete the old phone and did not rename the new one to the old phone's name, iCloud3 may still be tracking the old one. Look at the devices model number to make sure the assignment is correct.

    Remember, the device might still be tracked with the iOS App but getting Location Old errors from iCloud.

It is helpful to have a device that tracks correctly. Compare it's settings with the one that is not being tracked.
