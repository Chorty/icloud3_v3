Beta 2 - 12/17/2022
-------------------
1.  Do not display an error messgage when trying to get the model of a device if t is
    not in the HA device registry. (entity_io:137)
2.  Fix a problem checking if info for all of configured devices that had been set
    up had been returned from iCloud account during startup. If not, the FmF devices
    were being refreshed when it should be refreshing the FamShr devices. (start_ic3:1315)
3.  Fixed an error copying the Event Log image sample files to the custom cards directory.
    It was copyingthe files from 'event_log' instead of 'event_log_card'. (start_ic3:722)
4.  Added 'Erase All Devices' to the Configuration > Action menu that will reinitialize the
    iCloud3 Devices List.
5.  The Time Format (12/24-hour) was converted incorrectly. It was creating '12/24-hour-hour'
    This has been fixed and the invalid parameter in the configuration file was corrrected.
6.  Fixed a problem where a check was being made to see if 2fa authentication was needed when
    the connection to the iCloud Location Services had not been completed, causing a problem
    with the parameter migration (icloud_main:732).
7.  Reformatted the items written to the icloud3_migration.log file for clarity.
8.  Fixed a problem shrinking the Event Log (event_log:538 recursion error).
9.  Fixed a problem when Family Sharing info from iCloud Location Services had not completely
    loaded during initialization and was generating an error during the retry operation (start_ic3:1113).
10. Fixed a problem, hopefully, that was generating the HA Blocking error when starting up the iCloud
    Location Services interface. This was also occurring (sometimes) when logging into a new the iCloud
    account from the Configurator.

Beta 3 - 12/21/2022
-------------------
1.  Fixed a problem where the Configurator > Sensors would generate an 'Unknown Error Ocurred'
    error message. This was caused by an invalid sensor field name ('tracking_from_zones')
    in the configuration file.
2.  Fixed a problem on the Configurator > Sensors screen dealing with an invalid 'battery_status'
    error message.
3.  Fixed a problem where error messages were displayed getting device info from the HA device
    registry when the device was not in the registry.
4.  Fixed a problem displaying the obscured email address if there was more than one @-sign
    in the address.
5.  Added 'Reinitialize All Devices' to the Configurator > iCloud3 Devices screen. With it,
    you can remove all devices from iCloud3 or reset the selections for the iCloud FamShr & FmF
    and the iOS App parameters to `None`. This will clear any errors due to device migration errors.
6.  Setting up the log_level (info, debug, rawdata) a lot earlier. It is now setup when HA loads iCloud3
    instead of later. Debug and RawData information should now be written to the HA Log file
    (home-assistant.log) when the iCloud Account connection is first established.
7.  Moved `Event Log Configuration` option to Menu Page 1 and moved `Display Text As` option to Menu
    Page 2. Also added the `Log Level` parameter to the Event Log Configuration screen. This
    will reduce the steps needed to change the Log Level parameter when debug/rawdata logging
    is desired. ---> YOU MAY NEED TO REFRESH YOUR BROWSER WITH THE CONFIGURATOR OPEN <---
8.  Fixed problem changing the devices Friendly Name that would generate an error message deleting
    tracking_from_zone sensors when they had not been created. 
9.  The device_tracker state value is now lower-case.
10. Log level debug and rawdata records are now written to the '/config/icloud3_debug.log' file
    instead of the HA log file. A new file is created every time HA starts.
11. The file extension for the Event Log file was changed from '.txt' to '.log'. The file name is now
    'icloud3-event-log_[time].log'.
