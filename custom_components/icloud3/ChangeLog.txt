Beta 6 - 12/30/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Corrected a mispelled directory name used for installing sample device images (ipad.png, watch.png).
    The image directory nane was 'event_log_cad'. It should be 'event_log_card'.
2.  A new icloud3-debug.log file will now be created when restarting iCloud3 from the Event Log or when
    HA was started and the log level is debug. New records will be added to the existing log file when
    debug is started from Event Log > Actions and the log file is less than 20-hours old.
3.  Fixed a problem where location data from iCloud FamShr/FmF was not always being rejected due to poor
    gps_accuracy. This could lead to location & zone errors until the next locate was processed.
4.  Improved the performance displaying the results of the Initial Device Locate results in the Event Log.
5.  The Event Log for the selected devices is automatically refreshed when new information is added. The
    number of items was increased from 15 to 50 so more events are displayed without refreshing.
6.  Added a prefilter to the rawdata debug log to make sure usernames & passwords are not displayed.
7.  Some internal code cleanup and minor tweaking.


Beta 5 - 12/28/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a 'log_info_msg' not defined error message in the routine that identifies the notify
    service  used for a device. This is just an informative message indicating HA has not set it
    up yet.
2.  Periodically, the events currently displayed for a device is reduced from all events to less
    than a screen. This number was increased from 1/2-screen to about 2-screens.
3.  When the displayed events for a device were reduced (#2 above), the screen was never refreshed
    so you would always see the old events and had to do a refresh to see the latest events. Now,
    the device's events are automatically refreshed when they are updated.
4.  Updated the Event Log Lovelace card to v3.0.1. This fixes a problem when the date/time should not
    be displayed if there was an alert message was displayed.


Beta 4 - 12/27/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Inactive/Untracked devices are listed at the end of the Startup Event Log messages.
2.  Fixed some problems displaying the EVent Log when there were no devices to track.
3.  Fixed problem dealing with Gb.ic3_debug_log_write_secs variable not found.
4.  Fixed problem where the Event Log records were not displayed in a timely manner when starting.
5.  The tracking results written to the Log file now include the zone, distance and time values.
6.  Reworked the icloud3-debug.log file:
        - A new file is created when:
            - HA/iCloud3 starts and the Log Level is debug or rawdata or
            - Starting Debug Logging from Event Log > Actions or
            - At midnight when debug logging is on and the file is more thn 20-hours old.
        - Otherwise debug records are added to the existing Debug Log file.
        - If the Log Level is debug or rawdata in the Configurator > Event Log parameters and
          Stop Debug Logging was selected on Event Log > Actions, the configuration will be changed
          to 'info' (no debug logging).
        - If the configuration is set to 'info' (no debug logging) and it is started on
          Event Log > Actions, the configuration is not updated and the debug logging will remain
          on until midnight, the next iCloud3 restart or when it is turned off.


QUESTION: Currently the Exported Event Log file contains the date/time indicating when it was created.
          This creates a new file for every export.
                Example: 'icloud3-event-log_2022-12-26 18:00:00.log'
          Another option is to not have the date/time in the file name so a new Export overrites
          the last one.
                Example: 'icloud3-event-log.log'

          Does anyone have an opinion on this.

Beta 3 - 12/24/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Fixed a problem where the Configurator > Sensors would generate an 'Unknown Error Ocurred'
    error message. This was caused by an invalid sensor field name ('tracking_from_zones')
    in the configuration file.
2.  Fixed a problem on the Configurator > Sensors screen dealing with an invalid 'battery_status'
    error message.
3.  Fixed a problem where error messages were displayed getting device info from the HA device
    registry when the device was not in the registry.
4.  Fixed a problem displaying the obscured email address if there was more than one @-sign
    in the address.
5.  Added 'Reinitialize All Devices' to the Configurator > iCloud3 Devices screen. With it,
    you can remove all devices from iCloud3 or reset the selections for the iCloud FamShr & FmF
    and the iOS App parameters to `None`. This will clear any errors due to device migration errors.
6.  Setting up the log_level (info, debug, rawdata) a lot earlier. It is now setup when HA loads
    iCloud3 instead of later. Debug and RawData information should now be written to the HA Log file
    (home-assistant.log) when the iCloud Account connection is first established.
7.  Moved `Event Log Configuration` option to Menu Page 1 and moved `Display Text As` option to Menu
    Page 2. Also added the `Log Level` parameter to the Event Log Configuration screen. This
    will reduce the steps needed to change the Log Level parameter when debug/rawdata logging
    is desired. ---> YOU MAY NEED TO REFRESH YOUR BROWSER WITH THE CONFIGURATOR OPEN <---
8.  Fixed problem changing the devices Friendly Name that would generate an error message deleting
    tracking_from_zone sensors when they had not been created.
9.  The device_tracker state value is now lower-case.
10. Log level debug and rawdata records are now written to the '/config/icloud3_debug.log' file
    instead of the HA log file. A new file is created every time HA starts.
11. The file extension for the Event Log file was changed from '.txt' to '.log'. The file name is
    now 'icloud3-event-log_[time].log'.
12. Fixed problem displaying the Event Log when no devices had been configured.

Beta 2 - 12/17/2022
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.  Do not display an error messgage when trying to get the model of a device if t is
    not in the HA device registry. (entity_io:137)
2.  Fix a problem checking if info for all of configured devices that had been set
    up had been returned from iCloud account during startup. If not, the FmF devices
    were being refreshed when it should be refreshing the FamShr devices. (start_ic3:1315)
3.  Fixed an error copying the Event Log image sample files to the custom cards directory.
    It was copyingthe files from 'event_log' instead of 'event_log_card'. (start_ic3:722)
4.  Added 'Erase All Devices' to the Configuration > Action menu that will reinitialize the
    iCloud3 Devices List.
5.  The Time Format (12/24-hour) was converted incorrectly. It was creating '12/24-hour-hour'
    This has been fixed and the invalid parameter in the configuration file was corrrected.
6.  Fixed a problem where a check was being made to see if 2fa authentication was needed when
    the connection to the iCloud Location Services had not been completed, causing a problem
    with the parameter migration (icloud_main:732).
7.  Reformatted the items written to the icloud3_migration.log file for clarity.
8.  Fixed a problem shrinking the Event Log (event_log:538 recursion error).
9.  Fixed a problem when Family Sharing info from iCloud Location Services had not completely
    loaded during initialization and was generating an error during the retry operation.
10. Fixed a problem, hopefully, that was generating the HA Blocking error when starting up the
    iCloud Location Services interface. This was also occurring (sometimes) when logging into a new
    the iCloud ccount from the Configurator.
